## Tradoffs considered during system design
* If a job is, for some reason, terminated while the async worker has not yet finished its task, the PostgresDB will be half-updated. We consider this acceptable for the time being, and if we got feedback that this constraint is an issue, we could create a task progress queue to ensure that we know where to start up again if the task is brought back online and it sees the previous job was not completed (because there are items in the queue).
* Since I don't have control of the Netflix_Movie_Collection Google Drive folder, and it has only been shared with holtkam2@gmail.com, I have no way to make a service email account so that my ECS task can be granted direct access to GCP and retrieve a token.json. Therefore, we'll have to settle for a script I can run locally on my mac which lets me sign in, then gets a fresh token and pushes it to AWS Secrets Manager for my ECS task to make requets to the Google Drive API.
